# Code Comparator

Code Comparator is a script that allows you to compare the outputs of two code files written in different programming languages. It supports C++, C, and Java files. The script generates random inputs, executes the code files with those inputs, and compares the output generated by each code file.

## Requirements

To use the Code Comparator script, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

- Bash (version 4 or later)
- C++ compiler (g++)
- C compiler (gcc)
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

## Instructions

Follow these steps to use the Code Comparator script:

1. Clone the repository or download the script file (`hack_tool.sh`) to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script file is located.

3. Make the script file executable by running the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x code_comparator.sh
